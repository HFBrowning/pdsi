* pdsi
  Calculation of (sc)PDSI from monthly temperature and precipition
  data in R. This is basically a wrapper around the University of
  Nebraska's C++ based PDSI implementation from
  http://greenleaf.unl.edu/downloads/. This code has an unknown
  license, I treat it as MIT.

** Installation

#+begin_src R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("pdsi", "znag")
#+end_src

** Todo
   - Add support for Linux
   - Reliably remove temporary directories on Windows machines.
